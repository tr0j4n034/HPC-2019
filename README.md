## Acknowledgements

This course relies heavily on other courses and we gratefully acknowledge awesome work done by others - please let us know if reference to other resources is missing or reference is done incorrectly:

1. Book by Thomas Sterling Matthew Anderson Maciej Brodowicz "High Performance Computing. Modern Systems and Practices" 1st Edition
2. http://mpitutorial.com/   - one of the best resources to start with MPI
3. Amazing HPC course with videos, materials and assignments by creator of PyCUDA and PyOpenCL Prof. A. Kloeckner: https://andreask.cs.illinois.edu/Teaching/HPCFall2012
4. "Введение в параллельное программирование с использованием OpenMP и MPI" by Tomsk State University on Coursera - probably the most approachable course on parallel computing in Russian.
5. https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/cs344  "Intro to parallel computing" by John Owens and Dave Luebke - this is a must see course on GPU programming - our course is fully following this syllabus.
6. All materials written by Mark Harris from NVidia (especially on reduce and scan).
7. https://sites.google.com/lbl.gov/cs267-spr2019/  - Berkeley University course on applications of parallel computers (Aydin Buluc, Jim Demmel, Kathy Yelick)
8. Various blogs and websites that give tips and tricks on parallel computing.
